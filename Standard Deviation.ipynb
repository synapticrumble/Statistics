    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have introduced two measures of spread; the range (covered by all the data) and the inter-quartile range (IQR), which looks at the range covered by the middle 50% of the distribution. We also noted that the IQR should be paired as a measure of spread with the median as a measure of center. We now move on to another measure of spread, the standard deviation, which quantifies the spread of a distribution in a completely different way.\n",

    "# Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the standard deviation is to quantify the spread of a distribution by measuring how far the observations are from their mean. The standard deviation gives the average (or typical distance) between a data point and the mean."

    "\n",
    "**Question:** How long do the middle 95% of human pregnancies last?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The middle 95% of pregnancies last within 2 standard deviations of the mean, or in this case 234-298 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What percent of pregnancies last more than 298 days?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** To answer this consider the following picture: \n",
    "<img src=\"sdgraph5.gif\">\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Since 95% of the pregnancies last between 234 and 298 days, the remaining 5% of pregnancies last either less than 234 days or more than 298 days. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, these 5% of pregnancies are divided evenly between the two tails, and therefore 2.5% of pregnancies last more than 298 days. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How short are the shortest 2.5% of pregnancies?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Using the same reasoning as in the previous question, the shortest 2.5% of human pregnancies last less than 234 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What percentage of human pregnancies last more than 266 days?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Since 266 days is the mean, approximately 50% of pregnancies last more than 266 days.\n",
